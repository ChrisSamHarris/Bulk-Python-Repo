# ===== Challenge ==========
#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. 
#e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(type(two_digit_number))
new_num0 = int(two_digit_number[0])
new_num1 = int(two_digit_number[1])

final = new_num0 + new_num1
print(final)

### BMI CALCULATOR =====================

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height_int = float(height)
weight_int = float(weight)

bmi = (weight_int / (height_int * height_int))
# bmi = (weight_int / (height_int**2))

print(int(bmi))

### How long left calculator =====================

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
expect = 90 - int(age)
#print(expect)
days = str(expect * 365)
weeks = str(expect * 52)
months =  str(expect * 12)

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
